# Documentation

It seems you want to help improve the documentation on PLating. Great!!

## The book
One way is to work on this book itself. Head over to github and start writing :)

## Additional Info

Plating is on several platforms, e.g. github, crates.io and othersâ€¦
On all those plattforms, we need texts and other ressources. Most of this information is provided by file in our repo. Feel free to send PRs with improvements.

## Icons
You're not good with words? Perfect, we still need icons, favicons and screenshots :) Please get in contact, preferably in a github issue to discuss :)
