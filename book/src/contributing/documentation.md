# Documentation

It seems you want to help improve the documentation on PLating. Great!!

## The book
One way is to work on this book itself. Head over to github and start writing :)

## Supplemental Info

Plating is on platforms like github, crates.io and othersâ€¦
On all those plattforms, we need texts and other ressources. We try to supply as much of this information from files in this repository. This way we have them versioned and anybody can help out. Feel free to send PRs with improvements.

## Icons
You're not good with words? Perfect, we still need icons, favicons and screenshots :) Please get in contact, preferably in a github issue to discuss :)
