 TODO: short description of what it does

 ## The Name

> "Plating is a surface covering in which a metal is deposited on a conductive surface." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plating)

Pretty Technical, but it means we use Plating for:
- *"decorating objects"* (UI)
- *"corrosion inhibition"* (RUST)

There you have it: *****PLATING is the UI for RUST*****
